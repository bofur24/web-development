            <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organismas.
               The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases
               (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life</p>

                <li>Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.</li>
                <li>There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names</li>
                <li>Color pickers can help you find the color you want.</li>
                <li>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content)</li>
                <li>CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.</li>
                <li>CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is know as HSLA</li>
