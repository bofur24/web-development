        <h2>SUMMARY IMAGES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The &lt;img&gt; element is used to add images to a web page.</li>
            <li>You must always specify an src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.</li>
            <li>You should save images at the size you will be suing them on the web page and in the appropriate format.</li>
            <li>Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.</li>
        </ul>
