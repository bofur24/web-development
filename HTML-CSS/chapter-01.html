        <ul>
            <li>HTML pages are text documents.</li>
            <li>HTML uses tags, wich are characters that sit inside angled brackets. 
                They act like containers and tell you something about the information that lies between them.
            </li>
            <li>Tags are often referred to as elements.</li>
            <li>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of conten; the closing tag denotes the end.</li>
            <li>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.</li>
            <li>Attributes require a name and a value.</li>
            <li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what thye do, and where thye can go.</li>
