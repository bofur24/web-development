            <ul>
                <li>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.</li>
                <li>Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).</li>
                <li>Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.</li>
                <li>Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.</li>
                <li>CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.</li>
