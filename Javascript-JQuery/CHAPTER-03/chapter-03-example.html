            <ul>
                <li>Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.</li>
                <li>Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.</li>
                <li>An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something form the world around you.</li>
                <li>In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are know as methods of the object.</li>
                <li>Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the dcument loaded into the browser window.</li>
                <li>JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.</li>
                <li>Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).</li>
